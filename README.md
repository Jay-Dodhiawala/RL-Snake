# Creating snake AI with Reinforcement Learning
___

## 1. Setup the environment for the agent 
Libraries used
1. pygame 
2. random
3. Enum (from enum)
4. namedtuple (from collections)

Implement the famous Snake game(very basic game with no graphics and all) as to create an environment for my AI aget to train in.
This game was created with the help of pygame, random, Enum and numedtuple 
(last 2 libraries are just to make my life easy.
___

## 2. preparing the environment to be used by agent
Extra library used
1. numpy

changed some function so that they take input without being users. 
And numpy is only used for comparing.
___

## 3. Agent and model
Libraries used
1. import torch 
2. random 
3. deque (collections)
4. numpy
5. torch 
6. os

 Now we build a model and agent which plays a game for us and the 
 model was created with the help of pytorch library which takes in 11 input and give 3
 output
